## Explanation Of Tasks

#TASK 1:
I've created a random tensor of shape (4,6) and finded it's rank and shape using tensor flow.
And after that I've reshaped the created tensor into another shape and transposed the new shape and broadcasted a small tensor to maatch the larger tensor and added them.

Task 2:
In this I've implemented and compared loss functions by using matplotlib.

Task 3:
In this,I've trained MNIST model with both adam and SGD and compared their accuracy trends.

Task 4:
In this I've trained a neural network and enabled tensor board logging and after that I've analyzed the loss and accuracy trends.
